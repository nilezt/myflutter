# Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application that allows users to take pictures and record audio. The application provides a simple interface with two buttons on the home screen to navigate to the "Take a Picture" and "Record Audio" screens.

## Features

### Home Screen
- Displays two buttons: "Take a Picture" and "Record Audio".
- Navigates to the respective screens when the buttons are pressed.

### Take a Picture
- Uses the device's camera to display a preview.
- A floating action button allows the user to take a picture.
- After taking a picture, it is displayed on a new screen.
- The user can save the picture to the device.

### Record Audio
- Allows the user to start and stop audio recording.
- Displays a list of previously recorded audio files.
- The user can play back the recorded audio files.
- Displays a waveform of the selected audio file.

## Style and Design
- The application uses a simple Material Design theme.
- The color scheme is based on `Colors.lightBlue`.
- The UI is composed of standard Flutter widgets like `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `ElevatedButton`, `ListView`, etc.

## Current Task: Fix Compilation Errors

### Plan
- **Identify and fix compilation errors:** The application was failing to compile due to issues with the `audio_waveforms` package.
- **Update code to new API:** The `audio_waveforms` package had breaking changes. The code has been updated to use the new API.
    - Replaced `WaveformController` with `PlayerController`.
    - Updated the `preparePlayer` and `startPlayer` method calls.
- **Fix typos:** Corrected typos in variable names and method parameters.
- **Run tests:** Ensured that all tests pass after the fixes.
