# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for adding a camera feature to the Flutter application. The feature will allow users to take pictures and save them to a specific folder in the application's documents directory.

## Current Request: Add Camera Feature

### Plan

1.  **Add Dependencies:**
    *   Add `camera` package for camera access.
    *   Add `path_provider` package to get the application's document directory.
    *   Add `path` package for path manipulation.

2.  **Update `main.dart`:**
    *   Modify the `main` function to be asynchronous and get the list of available cameras.
    *   Create a `CameraScreen` widget to display the camera preview and a button to take a picture.
    *   Create a `DisplayPictureScreen` to display the captured image.
    *   Update the `MyHomePage` to include a button to navigate to the `CameraScreen`.

3.  **Save Picture:**
    *   When a picture is taken, it will be saved to a directory named `pictures` inside the application's documents directory.

### Implementation Details

*   **`main.dart`:**
    *   The `main` function will be modified to ensure `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is called and to get the first available camera.
    *   The `MyApp` widget will be updated to pass the camera description to the `MyHomePage`.
*   **`CameraScreen`:**
    *   Will be a `StatefulWidget`.
    *   `initState`: Initialize `CameraController`.
    *   `build`: Display `CameraPreview` and a `FloatingActionButton` to take a picture.
    *   `dispose`: Dispose the `CameraController`.
*   **`DisplayPictureScreen`:**
    *   A simple `StatelessWidget` that takes the image path as a parameter and displays the image using `Image.file`.
